# Release procedure

`tfe-run` follows [the recommendation from the GitHub Actions team][actions-versioning], namely that each release has a semantic version (i.e. `v1.0.1`). We also provide a major version tag (i.e. `v1`) that binds to the latest semantic version.

[actions-versioning]: https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md#versioning

Follow these steps to create a new release:
- create a new release from the Relases page.
- assign it a tag with semantic version.
